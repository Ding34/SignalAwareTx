Signal Aware Transfer

----------
Simple app that

1. Listen to signal strength changes

2. Defer sending during poor signal strengths
   Only above certain signal strength threshold
   will the transfer be allowed.

----------
Three deferring policies, corresponding to different
signal strength threshold value:

1. Performance: allow transfer under relatively low signal
2. Moderate: allow transfer under moderate signal
3. Powersaving: allow transfer only under good signal
